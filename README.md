# EDA_Countries_Dataset
- The aim of this project is to do Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset of the countries of the world and find out which attributes can be the best predictors for GDP (per capita). 
- EDA is a process of performing investigations on the data to find patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis and check assumptions by performing some statistics and checking graphical representations. 
- EDA is simply about exploring the data and possibly formulate hypothesis.
